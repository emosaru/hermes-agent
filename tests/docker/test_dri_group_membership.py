"""GPU (/dev/dri) passthrough must survive the s6-setuidgid privilege drop.

Two halves of one bug, both exercised against the real built image:

  1. The image ships a VAAPI driver, so libva can dispatch at all. ffmpeg is
     built with vaapi/qsv, but without a ``*_drv_video.so`` every hardware
     encode fails at vaInitialize and silently falls back to software.
  2. stage2-hook.sh gives the ``hermes`` user an /etc/group entry matching the
     GID of each passed-in /dev/dri node. ``docker run --group-add`` alone is
     not enough: initgroups() rebuilds the supplementary list from /etc/group
     during the privilege drop and discards the kernel-granted GID. This is
     the same trap the Docker-socket block above it already handles.

The device nodes are created with ``mknod`` inside the container (CAP_MKNOD is
in Docker's default set) rather than passed through with ``--device``, so these
tests run on CI machines with no GPU. ``/dev`` is a fresh tmpfs on every boot,
so the hook is re-run in place instead of via a container restart.
